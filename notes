Ploynomial time : an algorithm that runs in polynomial time means , the number of
                  steps of processing required is a polynomial function of input size.

P, NP Problems

P : problem can be solved using algorithm that runs in polynomial time.
    P problems are said to have feasible solutions because an algorithm
    that runs in ploynomial time can output its result in acceptable length of time.
